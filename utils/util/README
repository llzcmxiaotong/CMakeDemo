Although Macros are defined and called in the same manner as functions, there are some differences between them, for example in SCOPE and when its execution.

SCOPE:

Macro: has global scope.
Function: has a local scope whether you don't specify.
EXECUTION: it works like C++ or C

Macro: the variable names are replaced to strings before configuring.
Function: the variable names are replaced during execution.
In conclusion, add the PARENT_SCOPE flag in set command

set(PROTO_FILES ${PROTO_FILES} ${file_name} PARENT_SCOPE)

so we use macro when we write sub_dirs_recurse
